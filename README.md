Fun flight routines I run on my DJI Tello
https://store.dji.com/product/tello

Right now I only have 2 flight routines

- FaceTracking, which follows this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmEcyQnfpDA&t=2376s
- FaceTracking_V2, which is based off of this project: https://github.com/juanmapf97/Tello-Face-Recognition


I am working on making changes to FaceTracking_V2 to incorporate pid controller like movements as oppossed to just distance

More flight routines to come! 



to run a routine, run

`python fly.py <FaceTracking> or <FaceTracking_V2>`
